The Stump Window Manager
------------------------

Stumpwm is a window manager written entirely in Common Lisp. It
attempts to be highly customizable while relying entirely on the
keyboard for input. You will not find buttons, icons, title bars, tool
bars, or any of the other conventional GUI widgets.

These design decisions reflect the growing popularity of productive,
customizable lisp based systems.

Build & Start Stumpwm
---------------------

Prerequisites
=============

* a common lisp distribution.  sbcl, clisp, ccl and ecl all work.
* asdf
* clx
* cl-ppcre

The recommended way to install the dependencies is using Quicklisp.
Follow the instructions at http://www.quicklisp.org/ to install and
add it to your lisp init file.  Then, in a repl:

 (ql:quickload "clx")
 (ql:quickload "cl-ppcre")

Building
========

Building stumpwm from git requires that you build the configure script:

 autoconf

If there's already a configure script then just run it.

 ./configure

By default stumpwm elects sbcl.  If you have multiple lisps installed,
you can explicitly select clisp, ccl, or ecl like so:

 ./configure --with-lisp=clisp

If your lisps are in strange places you may need to tell the script
where to find them:

 ./configure --with-sbcl=/home/sabetts/opt/bin/sbcl
 ./configure --with-clisp=/usr/local/downstairs/to/the/left/clisp

Now build it:

 make

If all goes well, you should have a stumpwm binary now.  You can run
the binary from where it is or install it, along with the .info
documentation, with:

 make install

Now that you have a binary, call it from your ~/.xinitrc file:

 echo /path/to/stumpwm >> ~/.xinitrc
 startx

Hopefully that will put you in X running stumpwm!

CCL And Virtual Memory
----------------------

On 64bit platforms, CCL reserves a "very large" amount of virtual
memory. If this bothers you for some reason, you can pass the -R or
--heap-reserve option to the binary in your ~/.xinitrc file. See
http://ccl.clozure.com/manual/chapter15.1.html for an explanation.

Help
----

There's a texinfo manual, stumpwm.texi.  The build scripts generate an
info file you can read in emacs or with the `info' program.  The
manual for the latest release is available to read online at:

There's a #stumpwm channel on irc.freenode.net, too.
