;;; Commentary:

;;; Overview
;; This file implements dynamic tiling à la DWM, where windows are organized
;; into the master window and the window stack. There exists one master window
;; per head within a group. When a new window is added to a head within the
;; group, that heads master window is pushed onto that heads stack, and the new
;; window becomes the master window.

;;; Window Placement Policy
;; When a window is added to a dynamic group it must be determined which head to
;; place the window upon. This is controlled by the class allocated slot
;; head-placement-policy. It can either be a keyword of :FIRST through :FIFTH,
;; in which case the window is placed on that head, or the keyword
;; :CURRENT-FRAME, in which case the head of the current frame is selected.

;;; Overflow Policy
;; In the event that the head a window is to be placed upon is full, a window,
;; head, and group are chosen as backups. The chosen window is then moved to the
;; chosen head or, if that head is itself full, to the chosen group. The window
;; can be chosen by one of four keywords, :NEW-WINDOW, :MASTER-WINDOW,
;; :STACK-BEG, and :STACK-END. The head can be chosen by one of the keywords
;; :FIRST through :FIFTH, or :ANY and :ORDERED. :ANY uses the first empty head
;; it can find, while :ORDERED looks for the lowest numbered head. The group can
;; be chosen by any valid string. The group will be created if it does not
;; exist.

;;; Window Layouts
;; The location of the master window can be chosen on a global or per head
;; basis. The location can be chosen by one of four keywords, :LEFT :RIGHT :TOP
;; and :BOTTOM. Likewise, the amount of space given to the master window can
;; chosen on a global or per head basis. This is given as a number (fraction)
;; between zero and one exclusive representing the amount of the screen to give
;; to the master window. In practice it must be large enough that the master
;; window is not smaller than the minimum frame width/height and small enough
;; that the window stack is not smaller than the minimum frame width/height.
