@node Starting StumpWM, Basic Usage, Introduction, Introduction
@section Starting StumpWM
There are a number of ways to start StumpWM but the most straight
forward method is as follows. This assumes you have a copy of the
StumpWM source code and are using the @samp{SBCL} Common Lisp
environment.

@enumerate
@item
Install @samp{SBCL}, the @samp{portable-clx} package, and
@samp{cl-ppcre}. In Debian, @samp{portable-clx} is the
@samp{cl-clx-sbcl} package. You can also use @samp{asdf-install} to
download and install clx:

@example
$ sbcl
* (require :asdf)
* (require :asdf-install)
* (asdf-install:install :clx)
* (asdf-install:install :cl-ppcre)
@end example

Note that asdf-install requires @samp{gnupg}.

@item
In the @file{stumpwm} directory, run @samp{./configure}.

@item
run @samp{make}. If all goes well,
this should create a @file{stumpwm} executable.

@item
In your @file{~/.xinitrc} file include the line
@command{/path/to/stumpwm}. Remember to replace @samp{/path/to/}
with the actual path.

@item
Finally, start X windows with @command{startx}. Cross your
fingers. You should see a @samp{Welcome To the Stump Window Manager}
message pop up in the upper, right corner. At this point, you have
successfully started StumpWM.
@end enumerate

@node Basic Usage, Interacting with the Lisp process, Starting StumpWM, Introduction
@section Basic Usage
Once you have StumpWM up and running, the first thing you might want
to do is start @samp{Emacs}. Type @kbd{C-t e}, or in other words
@kbd{Control + t} followed by @kbd{e}. Now perhaps you want an
@samp{xterm}. Type @kbd{C-t c}. Now you have some programs running.

To see a list of windows StumpWM is managing, type @kbd{C-t w}. The
highlighted window is the one you're looking at right now. It's the
focused window.

All of StumpWM's keys are bound to named commands, which can be
executed not only by keys but also from the input bar. Type @kbd{C-t
;} to open a command prompt. Now type @samp{time} and press
return. Note, @samp{time} can also be called by typing @kbd{C-t a}.
Throughout this manual you'll find definitions for commands,
functions, and variables. Any command you see in this manual can be
executed from the input bar or bound to a key.

At this point you probably want to switch back from your new
@samp{xterm} to @samp{Emacs}. Type @kbd{C-t C-t}. This runs the
@command{other} command. Type it again and you're back to xterm.

Perhaps you'd like to see @samp{emacs} and @samp{xterm}
side-by-side. Type @kbd{C-t s}. You have now split the screen into 2
@samp{frames}. For more information @xref{Frames}. To switch to the
empty frame type @kbd{C-t TAB}. Now let's pull the xterm window into
this empty frame. Type @kbd{C-t w} for a window listing. Find the
@samp{xterm} window. See the number beside it? Type @kbd{C-t} followed
by @samp{xterm}'s window number.

Another common activity is browsing the interwebs. Type @kbd{C-t !}.
The input bar pops up again. You can now run a shell command.  Let's
start a web browser: type @samp{firefox} into the input bar and press
return.

Unfortunately, @samp{firefox} probably isn't wide enough because it's
in one of the frames. Type @kbd{C-t Q} to remove all frames but the
current one and resize it to fit the screen.

For a full list of key bindings, @xref{List of Default Keybindings}.

@node Interacting with the Lisp process, Contact the StumpWM developers, Basic Usage, Introduction
@section Interacting with the Lisp process

Since StumpWM is a Lisp program, there is a way for you to evaluate
Lisp code directly, on the same Lisp process that StumpWM is running on.
Type @kbd{C-t :} and an input box will appear. Then type some Lisp
expression.

When you call eval this way, you will be in the COMMON-LISP-USER
package. In order to use all the functions and variables defined in
the StumpWM manual, you need to explicitly mention the package stumpwm:

@table @asis
@item stumpwm:*mode-line-border-width*
Reads the value of *mode-line-border-width*.

@item (setf stumpwm:*mode-line-border-width* 3)
Sets the variable *mode-line-border-width* to 3.

@item (stumpwm:set-prefix-key (stumpwm:kbd "C-M-H-s-z"))
Calls the set-prefix-key function (and sets a new keyboard prefix)
@end table

@itemx C-t C-9
Pull the window with the corresponding number into the current frame

@item C-t n
@itemx C-t C-n
@itemx C-t Space
Go to the next window in the window list

@item C-t p
@itemx C-t C-p
Go to the previous window in the window list

@item C-t '
Go to a window by name

@item C-t "
Select a window from a list and focus the window.

@itemx C-t C-g
Abort the current command. This is useful if you accidentally hit @kbd{C-t}

@item C-t w
List all the windows

@item C-t 0-9
Select a window by number

@item C-t i
Display information about the current window.

@item C-t f
Select a frame by number

@item C-t s
Split current frame vertically

@item C-t S
Split current frame horizontally

@item C-t k
@itemx C-t C-k
Sends a kill message to the current frame and the running program.

@item C-t K
Kills the current frame and running program; like a kill -9.

@item C-t c
@itemx C-t C-c
Run an X terminal; by default xterm

@item C-t e
@itemx C-t C-e
Run Emacs or raise it if it is already running.

@item C-t t
Sends a @key{C-t} to the frame; this is useful for applications like Firefox
which make heavy use of @key{C-t} (in Firefox's case, for opening a new
tab). This is similar to how GNU screen uses @kbd{C-a a}.

@item C-t w
@itemx C-t C-w
Prints out a list of the windows, their number, and their name.

@item C-t b
@itemx C-t C-b
Banish the mouse point to the lower right corner of the screen.

@item C-t a

@item C-t C-t
Switch to the last window to have focus in the current frame.

@item C-t !
Prompt for a shell command to run via @file{/bin/sh}. All output is discarded.

@item C-t R
If the screen is split into multiple frames, one split will be
undone. If there is only one split, the effect will be the same as @kbd{C-t Q}.

@item C-t o
@itemx C-t TAB
If the screen is split into multiple frames, focus shifts to the
@command{next} frame, where it cycles to the right and then down; analogous
to @kbd{C-x o} in Emacs.

@item C-t F
Display ``Current Frame'' in the frame which has focus.

@item C-t ;
Opens the input box. StumpWM commands can be run from here, and the
input history moved through.

@item C-t :
Opens the input box, but all things typed in here will be sent to the
Common Lisp interpreter where they will be ran as Lisp programs; thus,
input should be valid Common Lisp.

@item C-t C-h
@itemx C-t ?
The help.

@item C-t -
Hide all frames and show the root window.

@item C-t Q
Removes all splits and maximizes the frame with focus.

@item C-t Up
@itemx C-t Down
@itemx C-t Left
@itemx C-t Right
Shift focus to an adjacent frame in the specified direction. @kbd{C-t Up} will
shift focus up, if possible, @kbd{C-t Down} will shift downwards, etc.

@item C-t v
Prints out the version of the running StumpWM.

@item C-t #
Toggle the mark on the current window

@item C-t m

It is sometimes handy to deny a window's request to be focused. The
following variables determine such behavior.

A map request occurs when a new or withdrawn window requests to be
mapped for the first time.

A raise request occurs when a client asks the window manager to give
an existing window focus.

### *deny-map-request*
### *deny-raise-request*
### *suppress-deny-messages*

Some examples follow.

@example
;; Deny the firefox window from taking focus when clicked upon.

;; Deny all map requests
(setf stumpwm:*deny-map-request* t)

;; Deny transient raise requests
(push '(:transient) stumpwm:*deny-map-request*)

;; Deny the all windows in the xterm class from taking focus.

@node Mode-line, Groups, Frames, Top
@chapter The Mode Line
The mode line is a bar that runs across either the top or bottom of
a head and is used to display information. By default the mode line
displays the list of windows, similar to the output C-t w produces.

Alternatively, external panel applications such as the GNOME panel and
KDE's kicker may be used. Simply starting one of these programs is enough
to set it as the mode line of the head it would like to be on (if the
panel is Xinerama aware) or whichever head is available. In order to
avoid problems displaying menus, configure your panel application for
positioning at the top or bottom of the head rather than relying on
@var{*mode-line-position*}

The mode line can be turned on and off with the @command{mode-line}
command or the lisp function @code{stumpwm:toggle-mode-line}. Each
head has its own mode line. For example:

@example
;; turn on/off the mode line for the current head only.
(stumpwm:toggle-mode-line (stumpwm:current-screen) (stumpwm:current-head))
@end example

The mode line is updated after every StumpWM command.

To display the window list and the current date on the modeline, one
might do the following:

@example
(setf stumpwm:*screen-mode-line-format*
      (list "%w | "
            '(:eval (stumpwm:run-shell-command "date" t))))
@end example

@code{(stumpwm:run-shell-command "date" t)} runs the command
@command{date} and returns its output as a string.

@chapter Colors
All text printed by stumpwm is run through a coloring engine before
being displayed. All color commands start with a @samp{^} (caret)
character and apply to all text after it.

@table @asis
@item ^0-9
A caret followed by a single digit number changes the foreground color
to the specified color. A @samp{*} can be used to specify the normal
color. See the color listing below.

@item ^0-90-9
A caret followed by two digits sets the foreground and background
color. The first digit refers to the foreground color and the second
digit to the background color. A @samp{*} can be used in place of
either digit to specify the normal color. See the color listing below.

@item ^B
Turn on bright colors.

@item ^b
Turn off bright colors.

@item ^n
Use the normal background and foreground color.

@item ^R
Reverse the foreground and background colors.

@item ^r
Turn off reverse colors.

@item ^[
Push the current colors onto the color stack. The current colors remain unchanged.

@item ^]
Pop the colors off the color stack.

@item ^^
Print a regular caret.
@end table

The default colors are made to resemble the 16 VGA colors and are:
@table @asis
@item 0 black
@item 1 red
@item 2 green
@item 3 yellow
@item 4 blue
@item 5 magenta
@item 6 cyan

StumpWM exports a number of hooks you can use to add customizations;
like hooks in Emacs, you add to a hook with the @code{add-hook}
function. for example:

@example
(stumpwm:add-hook 'stumpwm:*new-window-hook* 'my-new-window-custos)
@end example

adds your @code{my-new-window-custos} function to the list of
functions called when a new window appears.

@node General Advice, Using git with StumpWM, Hacking, Hacking
@section Hacking:  General Advice

@enumerate

@item
Pay attention to file names and contents. If you're making changes to
mode-line related code, don't put it in core.lisp. If you're
introducing some completely new featureset, consider putting all of
the new code in a new file.

@item
Does a command need to be user-visible ("interactive") or is it just
called by other commands?

@itemize
@item
If it's not going to be user-visible, you can just use the familiar
(defun foo ()...) syntax.

@item
If you want the command to be used interactively, you use StumpWM's
defcommand syntax, as in the examples below.

@example
    (defcommand test (foo bar)
       ((:string "How you're going to prompt for variable foo: ")
        (:number "How you want to prompt for variable bar: "))
       "This command is a test"
       (body...))

    (defcommand test2 () ()
       "This is also a test"
       (body...))

    (defcommand title (args) (interactive-args)
       "Doc string"
       (body...))
@end example

...so basically, inside the first set of parentheses after the
function name, you specify what (if any) arguments will be passed to
the command. The second set of parentheses tells StumpWM how to get
those arguments if they're not explicitly passed to the command. For
example,

@example
((:string "What do you want to do: "))
@end example

...will read a string from the input the user provides. The quoted
text is the prompt the user will see. Of course, if you were to, say,
call the command test, as defined above, from another piece of code,
it wouldn't give the prompt as long as you fed it arguments.
@end itemize

@item
Note that all commands defined using the defcommand syntax are
available both to be called with "C-t ;" and from within other lisp
programs, as though they had been defun-ned (which, in fact, they
have).

@item
Any code that depends on external libraries or programs that some
users might not have installed should be placed in the contrib/
directory.

@item
Don't be afraid to submit your patches to the StumpWM mailing list!
It may not immediately make it into the official git repository, but
individual users might find it useful and apply it to their own setup,
or might be willing to offer suggestions on how to improve the code.

@item
Remember:  StumpWM is designed to run on both clisp and on SBCL. If
you must use code specific to one or the other, at the very least warn
people that it only works with one lisp implementation. Better yet,
figure out how to do it in the other distribution and write a
statement like this:

@example
#+clisp
(your-clisp-code)
#+sbcl
(your-sbcl-code)
@end example

...to wrap the code for each lisp. Of course, the best option is to
find a way to use the same code for clisp and SBCL.
@end enumerate

@node Using git with StumpWM, Sending Patches, General Advice, Hacking
@section Hacking:  Using git with StumpWM

For quite a while now, StumpWM has been using the git version control
system for development. If you're one using one of the official
releases or still using the now-obsolete CVS version, you can get the
bleeding-edge source code from the official git repository with
a single command:

@example
$ git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/stumpwm.git
@end example

After this, you'll have a complete git repository, along with the
complete revision history since the switch. Feel free to play around;
git has some important features that actually make this safe!

Before we get to that stuff, though, you're going to want to tell git
about yourself so that your information is included in your commits
and patches. The very minimum you're going to want to do is:

@example
$ git config --global user.name "Anne N. O'Nymous"
$ git config --global user.email "anonymous@@foo.org"
@end example

Be sure to check out the manual for git-config--there are several
options you might want to set, such as enabling colorized output or
changing the editor and pager you use when making commits and viewing
logs.

For the sake of argument, let's say you want to make some major
changes to both user.lisp and core.lisp, add a file called
DANGEROUS_EXPERIMENT_DO_NOT_USE_OR_ELSE.lisp, and remove the manual
because you're too 1337 for such things. However, you don't want to
break your entire StumpWM setup and start over. Thankfully, you don't
have to. Before you get started, issue this command from the stumpwm
directory:

@example
$ git checkout -b experimental
@end example

You should now find yourself in a new branch, called experimental. To
confirm this, type "git branch" (without the quotes); there should be
an asterisk next to the branch you're currently viewing. At any time,
you can type "git checkout master" to return to your master branch,
and at any time you can have as many branches of the project as you
like. If you want to create a new branch based not on the master
branch but on your experimental branch, for example, you'd type:

@example
$ git checkout -b new-experiment experimental
@end example

This will place you in a newly-created branch called new-experiment
which should be identical to your experimental branch as of the last
commit (more on that soon). If you're actually typing out the
directions, switch back to your old experimental branch like so:

@example
$ git checkout experimental
@end example

Anyway, now that you have a new branch, create that new file with the
long name, which I'll just call danger.lisp for brevity. Make whatever
changes you want to it, and when you're done, tell git about your new
file.

@example
$ git add dangerous.lisp
@end example

Now, let's pretend you're done making changes. Tell git you're done
for now:

@example
$ git commit -a
@end example

This will open up a prompt in your editor of choice for you to
describe your changes. Try to keep the first line short, and then add
more explanation underneath (for an example, run the command "git log"
and take a look at some of the longer commit explanations). Save that
file and then do this:

@example
$ git checkout master
$ ls
@end example

...and look for your new file. It's not there! That's because you've
done all of your work in another branch, which git is currently hiding
from you so that you can "check out" the branch called "master." All
is as it should be--your master repository is still safe.

@example
$ git checkout experimental
@end example

Now, delete manual.lisp and stumpwm.texi. That's right. Wipe them off
the face of the Earth, or at least off the hard drive of your
computer. When you're done, you don't have to tell git you've deleted
them; it'll figure it out on its own (though things may not compile
properly unless you edit Makefile.in and stumpwm.asd. Anyway, go ahead
and edit core.lisp and user.lisp. Really break 'em. Run free! When
you're done, do another commit, as above, and give it a stupid title
like "lolz i b0rked stUmpwm guys wTF!?!?!!111!" Now try to compile.
Just try. It won't work. If it does, you're some kind of savant or
something. Keep up the good work. If you've actually managed to break
StumpWM like you were supposed to, never fear! You have two options at
this point.

One is to go back to the master branch (with another git checkout) and
just delete your experimental branch, like so:

@example
$ git branch -D
@end example

The "-D" means to force a delete, even if the changes you've made
aren't available elsewhere. A "-d" means to delete the branch if and
only if you've merged the changes in elsewhere.

The other option is to create patches for each of your commits so far,
delete the branch, and then apply any working/wanted patches in a new
branch. Create your patches (after committing) like so:

@example
$ git format-patch -o patches origin
@end example

(Before doing that you can review your changes with "git log origin..")

You can also use the format-patch command to create a patch of working
code to send in to the mailing list.

A developer might ask you to try out something they're working on. To
fetch their master branch, you'd do this:

@example
$ git remote add -f -m master -t master foo git://bar.org/~foo/stumpwm
@end example

...where "foo" is the shorthand name you'll use to refer to that
repository in the future. To checkout a local copy of that repository,
you'd then do this:

@example
$ git checkout --track -b foo-master foo/master
@end example

...and could use "git pull foo" to update later while looking at that
branch (and note that "git pull" with no arguments, in the master
branch, will update your StumpWM from the official repository.

Finally, if you want to move your experimental changes into your
master branch, you'd checkout your master branch and run:

@example
$ git merge experimental
@end example

If there are file conflicts, "git diff" will show you where they are;
you have to fix them by hand. When you're done, do another

@example
$ git commit -a
@end example

...to finalize the changes to your master branch. You can then delete
your experimental branch. Alternately, you can wait until your changes
(assuming you sent them in) make it into the official repository
before deleting your experimental branch.

@node Sending Patches,  , Using git with StumpWM, Hacking
@section Sending Patches
When sending patches to the mailing list for inclusion in StumpWM,
there are a few guidelines that will make everything go smoother.

@itemize
@item
Make sure it applies clean to the main git repository

@item
Ensure that you aren't introducing tabs, extra blank lines, or whitespace at the end of lines.

@item
Ensure your patch doesn't contain irrelevant indenting or reformatting changes.

@item
Try to make your patch address a single issue. If your patch changes
two unrelated issues, break them into two seperate patches that can
stand on their own.

@item
Don't send intermediate patches. When you're working on a feature you
might make several commits to your local repository as you refine it
and work out the bugs. When it's polished and ready to ship, send it
as one patch! Sometimes it makes sense to send it as multiple patches
if each patch contains a discrete feature or bug fix that can stand on
its own. If one of your patches changes code that was added or
modified in an earlier patch, consider merging them together and
sending them as one.
